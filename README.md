# Serial-Basys3
This is a VHDL proyect to receive and send data from the serial on the Basys 3

- Pmod RS232
The Pmod RS232 communicates with the host board via the UART protocol. The arrangement of the pins is the old UART communication style (Type 3 in the Digilent Pmod Interface Specification) so that a crossover cable will be required if attaching this Pmod to one of the dedicated UART Pmod headers on any of the newer Digilent microcontroller boards. For a list of which MCU boards use the old UART protocol, see our explanation
